## Timers

Timers allow you to execute a task at a specified time (UTC).<br/>
If the system time isn't plausible (e.g. like when it has never been synced), no timers will be executed.

Please note that timers are evaluated and stored as UTC. They are only displayed in your current browser timezone.<br/>
This means that they will not follow any DST rules and thus will have to be updated manually if so required.
