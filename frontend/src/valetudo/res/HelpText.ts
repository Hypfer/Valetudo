### What are those triangles on the map?

Those are segment labels.
If a segment is considered active by the robot - meaning that it is part of the robots current task - the triangle will
point down. Otherwise, it will point up.

If you zoom in on a segment label, it will display the segment ID, its name and also its size in mÂ².


### How do I open the controls of the home page on mobile?

Just tap on the bar at the bottom of the screen.

### How do I get the coordinates/parameters of segments/zones/go-to locations to trigger them via MQTT/REST?

Simply configure/select the segments/zones/go-to locations like you'd normally do and then long-press the button that would start the action.
This will bring up a dialog providing you with everything you'll need.

### What's up with the AI Assistant?

The "AI Assistant" feature is a joke about the joke that is our industry, featuring a JavaScript implementation of ELIZA.
Created in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum, ELIZA was one of the very first chatbots and is famous for being one of the earliest programs to fool people into thinking that it passed the Turing test.

Fittingly, Weizenbaum himself also had some opinions about this industry.<br/>
Quoting Wikipedia:<br/>
> His belief was that the computer, at its most base level, is a fundamentally conservative force and that despite being a technological innovation, it would end up hindering social progress.
> Weizenbaum used his experience working with Bank of America as justification for his reasoning, saying that the computer allowed banks to deal with an ever-expanding number of checks in play that otherwise would have forced drastic changes to banking organization such as decentralization.
> As such, although the computer allowed the industry to become more efficient, it prevented a fundamental re-haul of the system.
>
> Weizenbaum also worried about the negative effects computers would have with regards to the military, calling the computer "a child of the military."
