# Rules

1. No bad faith communication
2. No hidden agendas
3. Do not act against the interest of, or with lack of care for, the Valetudo mission
4. Participate with genuine respect for others as individuals, not treating them as obstacles or instruments
5. Do your own homework
6. Additional rules may be added if necessary


Rule interpretation can be subjective and may be exploited through bad-faith tactics like sea-lioning.
Therefore, when a violation is suspected, the burden of proof to demonstrate compliance lies with the user.

Failure to comply will lead to temporary or, in severe cases, permanent removal.

Additionally, temporary removal may be conducted when deemed necessary for signal-to-noise or de-escalative reasons.


# Rules - for normal people

1. Don't be a dick


# Appeal process

People found to be in violation of the rules have the option to appeal their case through the general process through which adults resolve misunderstandings and other conflicts.

This usually entails giving everyone involved time to cool down and think, then diplomatically reaching out in private, explaining where they came from, displaying effort being put into understanding, showing genuine regret for the situation and a desire to resolve it.
