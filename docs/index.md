</div>

Valetudo is the de-facto-standard open-source software solution for cloud-free vacuum robots empowering thousands of users.<br/>
Since it was started in 2018, it has matured to a reliable fire-and-forget solution that just works.

Valetudo is made, managed, maintained and more by me,
<a href="https://hypfer.de" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sören Beye</a>, with occasional contributions by
<a href="https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/graphs/contributors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">these awesome people</a>.<br/>
It would not exist without the ongoing work of <a href="https://dontvacuum.me/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dennis Giese</a>,
who is constantly providing us with new ways of liberating and gaining actual ownership of our robots.

As there is no telemetry built-in and no commercial interest to change that, I can't tell you how many users exactly are there,
however judging by download counts and support group members, I'd guesstimate that there are a few thousand.

If you want to learn more about why I'm building Valetudo, the answer is actually pretty simple:<br/>
When I was looking for a vacuum robot for myself, I didn't find anything that matched what I was looking for.<br/>
Thus, in a brief moment of hubris, I thought to myself: "How hard can it be?".<br/>
Now, four years later, we're here and I'm quite happy with how it turned out.

Valetudo is licensed under the Apache-2.0 open-source license, because you need to be able to know what your smart
devices are doing and also alter (some parts of) it without being dependent on some vendor and/or third party.
The only way of truly achieving that is by being able to see and modify the code.

The Apache-2.0 license is a very permissive license and a lot of work is being shared for free here, so I trust people to not take
advantage of that and sell Valetudo; especially not as their own work.<br/>
Please don't disappoint me. Thank you.

### Expectation Management
This project is the hobby of some random guy on the internet who really does not care about market share.<br/>
It does what I want it to do, so I'm happy with it.
