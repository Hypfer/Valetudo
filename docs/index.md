</div>

Valetudo is a standalone binary which runs on **rooted Vacuums of the Xiaomi ecosystem** and aims to enable the user to operate the robot vacuum without any Cloud Connection whatsoever.

These are the Valetudo Docs.
Simply use the navigation menu on the left to find what you're looking for.


If you're missing something or you've found something wrong or outdated, feel free to edit the page and open a PR.
You can also add new pages if you want to document something that isn't documented yet.

Also, make sure to check out the companion apps section.

### Expectation Management
Please note that Valetudo is a hobby project built by some random person on the internet for their own use,
which decided to distribute it for free and provide the source code as well, so that everyone could extend the
software to their own liking.

There's no money involved nor do I care about the size of my userbase.

This fact has a few implications:
* Changes that may break your workflow might occour at any time
* You aren't entitled to receive support
* Demanding changes will get you nowhere
* Neither will nagging
* "Software XY has feature Z so you have implement that as well" is also irrelevant
* Same goes for your personal priorities on which thing should be done next
* If you want something to be done, you will most likely have to do it yourself


With that out of the way, I'm of course always open to suggestions/ideas as long as they are well thought-out.

Thank you for using Valetudo :)
