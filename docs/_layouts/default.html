        // Social media (of which HN is one) are places that delete context. This is bad for a project like Valetudo,
        // which operates on different rules/visions/ideals than the current default, meaning that it relies on
        // people first processing the context provided in the docs (e.g. CoC, Why-not-Valetudo, FAQ, Contributing.md)
        //
        // Telling people to please consider context first has proven to be a futile move, meaning that every _single_ time
        // Valetudo gets posted there, it devolves and turns into shitflinging with nice words.
        // Every single time, you see
        // 1. The same few people that show up every time to voice their long-running grievances
        // 2. An ever-changing set of new people that ran into a wall of required context and process the negative emotions sparked from that
        // 3. Drive-by "advice" that boils down to "Hey, what about you just do the default"
        // 4. General trolling (Actually, this can at least be fun if done creatively)
        //
        // As said, the same is true for any large social media platform, however, doing the same with e.g. reddit would
        // have massive collateral damage. Not so much for HN.
        //
        // The idea here being not necessarily to "keep out" people, but rather "introduce friction" so that the usual drive-by nonsense doesn't happen
        // I expect that a lot of people that would otherwise mindlessly boost it for the (very simplistic) algorithm,
        // will just end up confused and ignore the post, leading to those that manually type the domain to be (a bit) pre-filtered
        //
        // If you're seeing this, chances are already a lot higher that you might comprehend the concept of context
        // If not, please just go away, thank you.
