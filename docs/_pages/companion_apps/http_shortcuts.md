# HTTP Shortcuts

If you don't have any home automation software but still want to add some comfort, you can install [HTTP Shortcuts](https://http-shortcuts.rmy.ch/) (also available on F-Droid), an app to issue arbitrary HTTP request.
You can create shortcuts for any action, such as starting and stopping your roboto.
But also you can start the cleaning of a segment or a predefined zone.
HTTP Shortcuts provides an URI for each action, which can be triggered via NFC stickers.
