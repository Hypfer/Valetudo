# Frequently requested features

## Translation support

While a lot of people are asking for this feature, I'm afraid it won't happen anytime soon if ever.

Let me explain the reasoning behind this with an example. Consider this car radio in a car made for the german market:

![Bosch Car Radio](./img/car_radio.jpg)

In fact, the radio is engineered by Bosch in Hildesheim. Still, the button isn't labeled `Karte`.

Now, let's take a look at the Valetudo UI (Version 0.6.1):

Regarding overall complexity, it's comparable to the buttons on the radio.
It's even easier to understand, because there are a lot more icons. <br/>
Considering that people do in fact manage to use their car radios even if their english skills may be lacking,
I'd say that **accessibility** isn't a problem here.


As a matter of fact, Internationalization isn't free. It always introduces more work, more complexity etc.<br/>
Of course **accessibility** is often worth the effort, however since we've already established that this factor isn't relevant here,
we can take a look at a non-exhaustive list of downsides of i18n:

* Getting support is harder when screenshots/error messages are in a language that isn't english, because supporters may not speak it
* Development of new features, refactoring etc. is always blocked by having to translate everything new to all languages
* Increased codebase complexity
    * Harder to read
    * Harder to work with
* Lots of initial work to translate everything
    * Time/effort that could be spent better elsewhere
