# Buying Supported Robots

The recommended source to buy a [supported robot](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) is
wherever it is cheapest. In general, when buying something, you should always use price comparison websites, shopping communities, check Aliexpress etc.

## Deciding on a Robot

Here are some questions you should ask yourself when deciding which supported robot to pick:
- What types of floor do you have?
- Do you need proper mopping?
- Do you want an Auto-Empty-Dock?
- Do you need a robot that detects and avoids obstacles such as cables?
- Do you have pets?
- Do you have people with long hair in your household?
- What is your budget?
- Where are you located?
- Are you comfortable with disassembling a robot?

Answering these questions should help you pick the right unit.

## Affiliate links

If you want to support the project, consider donating using [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Hypfer) instead
of using affiliate links as they are part of the advertising industry, which [some people might describe as bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0).

If Amazon is something that you like to use, here are some affiliate links for it.<br/>
The DE ones end up supporting me, Hypfer, while the non-DE ones fund Dennis' work.
Apparently it's easy for a US Amazon affiliate account to generate links on all the other Amazons but not the other way round.
