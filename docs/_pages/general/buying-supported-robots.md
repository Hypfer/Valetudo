# Buying Supported Robots

The recommended source to buy a [supported robot](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) is
wherever it is cheapest. In general, when buying something, you should always use price comparison websites, shopping communities, check Aliexpress etc.

## Recommendation

_Last update: 2023-08-11_

We have reached a point where giving out general recommendations doesn't really make sense anymore as there are just too
many supported robots with varying attributes such as features, price, rootability and also availability in your area.

Here are some questions you should ask yourself:
- What types of floor do you have?
- Do you need proper mopping?
- Do you want an Auto-Empty-Dock?
- Do you need a robot that detects and avoids obstacles such as cables?
- Do you have pets?
- Do you have people with long hair in your household?
- What is your budget?
- Where are you located?
- Are you comfortable with disassembling a robot?

Answering these questions should help you pick the right unit. If you require additional guidance, feel free to

But if you're _really_ only looking for a general recommendation, just buy the Dreame L10S Ultra.<br/>
It can do proper mopping, has an auto-empty-dock, obstacle avoidance, a rubber brush to better deal with long hair,
it can detect pet waste, it's priced competitively and it's also rootable without doing too scary things.
Basically it ticks all the boxes.

If full-blown mopping is not a requirement, the Roborock S8+ would likely be the most interesting model for you.<b/>
It has an auto-empty-dock, obstacle avoidance, dual rubber brushes that should provide somewhat better carpet performance
than a single one and it can detect pet waste. Its downsides are that you do pay for the brand and rooting is a bit more scary.

As these two are flagship robots, they tend to get more firmware updates than the mid-range models. That's also something
to keep in mind when picking the right robot for you.
