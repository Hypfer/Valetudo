# Buying supported robots

The recommended source to buy a [supported robot](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) is
wherever it is cheapest. After rooting, you won't have any warranty anyways, which is why buying local usually doesn't
offer any benefits apart from higher prices.

In general, when buying something, you should always use price comparison websites, shopping communities, check Aliexpress etc.

## Recommendation

As mentioned above, the [supported robots](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) offers an autogenerated
overview of all supported robots.

For your convenience however, here's the gist of it (updated 2022-08-05).

**Note:**
This list only features robots that can be fairly easy to root depending on the firmware they're running.
They're also ranked based on desirability due to features, performance, etc.

For buying a new robot, the best options would be the these:

- Dreame Z10
- Dreame L10

If you're on a budget, you could also consider buying one of these:

- Dreame D9 (not max!)
- Roborock S5 (used. They're not being made anymore) (not max!)

If you're even more on a budget, consider buying one of these:

- Dreame F9
- Dreame 1C


## Affiliate links

It has come to my attention that there are other people trying to make money off Valetudo by using it to get people to
click on their affiliate links. Therefore, I've decided to have my own affiliate links. I'm not exactly happy with this,
however if people want to use such things, they should at least use them in a way where the money ends up supporting the project.

If you want to support the project, consider donating using [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Hypfer) instead
of using affiliate links as they are part of the advertising industry, which [some people might describe as bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0).

## Germany

For price comparison, check out [geizhals.de](https://geizhals.de) or [idealo.de](https://idealo.de).
Also, don't forget [mydealz.de](https://mydealz.de) and of course [Aliexpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/).

If Amazon is something that you like to use, here are some **affiliate links** for it:
