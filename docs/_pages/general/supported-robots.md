# Supported Robots

At the time of writing, (2024-06-18), Valetudo supports more than 35 different Robots.<br/>
If you're interested in hardware specifics, teardowns and more, check out Dennis Giese's [Vacuum Robot Overview](https://robotinfo.dev/).

Please note that this list is exhaustive. These are the supported robots.<br/>
Robots not on this list are not supported by Valetudo. If your robot is not on this list, it is not supported.

Unless noted otherwise, these robots were all tested by me personally to ensure that:
- They work properly with Valetudo
- The way to get them to work with Valetudo is well documented
- I have an Idea how the thing works, how rooting works and what to do when things don't work

Being _supported_ means meeting these criteria. Only by fulfilling these conditions can a robot be deemed supported.

## Robots that aren't supported

While Valetudo tries its best to be generic and reuse code wherever possible, since it is not a custom firmware,
the backend is basically a few huge chunks of code that are very specific to the respective vendor firmware and cloud architecture they try to emulate.

Supporting any new vendors is thus quite a large task because not only requires it to write large parts of the backend
again from scratch but also do the reverse engineering of data formats, authentication, communication and various functionality
with no documentation from the vendor available.

It's a time-consuming process that mostly involves random chance and that can only start once security vulnerabilities
leading to system administrator level access on the hardware in question has been found. A similar reverse-engineering process
without any documentation that is also quite time-consuming and mostly involves random chance.

<br/>

Valetudo only runs on the supported robots because security researcher [Dennis Giese](https://dontvacuum.me) found ways
to root them.

Rooting in this context means taking these locked-down IoT devices, finding and exploiting security flaws in their design
and gaining permanent system administrator level access to them to allow for running additional custom software such as Valetudo
and modifying the system to make the unclouding possible.

These security flaws are all 0days of which we sometimes need multiple to achieve the rooting.<br/>
They're also specific to one specific vendor's implementation of something on one specific piece of hardware.

With a public root release, these get burned and usually quickly fixed by the vendors, making finding a working exploit chain
for newer models after the release harder or sometimes even impossible.

<br/>

Therefore, please refrain from asking if something that isn't on this list is supported.<br/>
Please do not ask if someone "tried" it. Please do not state that you would like it if something would be supported.

Without explicitly mentioning this, readers often expect that something not being supported just means that
no one has tried it yet, which is more akin to how e.g. running GNU+Linux on some random laptop works.

Thank you for your understanding

## Xiaomi<a id="xiaomi"></a>

Robots sold under the Xiaomi brand are actually made by varying manufacturers.<br/>
Don't assume any compatibility of consumables or other parts as well as rooting instructions.

### Xiaomi V1<a id="xiaomi_v1"></a>

<img src="./img/robots/xiaomi/xiaomi_v1.jpg" width="1300" height="397"/>

The Xiaomi V1 is made by Roborock. It is sold as:
- Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum

#### Comments

**Note:**<br/>
This robot never received firmware updates that enable persistent maps. This means that it creates a new one on every cleanup.<br/>
There are no virtual walls etc. Do **not** buy this new. There are **much better options**.

Rooting is pretty easy if your device was manufactured before 2020-03.<br/>
In that case, it only requires a Laptop. All warranty seals stay intact.

If your robot is newer than that, full disassembly will be required.

#### Details

**Valetudo Binary**: `armv7`
**Secure Boot**: `no`

#### Rooting instructions

The Xiaomi 1C is made by Dreame. It is sold as:
- Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop
- Xiaomi 1C
- STYTJ01ZHM

#### Comments

**Important note:** <br/>
There are multiple hardware revisions under the same name. Only the `dreame.vacuum.mc1808` is currently supported.

Rooting is pretty easy, only requiring a 3.3v USB UART Adapter, [the Dreame Breakout PCB](https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-dreameadapter) and almost no disassembly.
All warranty seals stay intact.

If you only see weird characters on the UART, try `500000` instead of `115200` as the baud rate.

#### Details

**Valetudo Binary**: `armv7`
**Secure Boot**: `no`

#### Rooting instructions

- [UART](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/installation/dreame.html#uart)

#### Comments

Rooting is pretty easy, only requiring a 3.3v USB UART Adapter, [the Dreame Breakout PCB](https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-dreameadapter) and almost no disassembly.
All warranty seals stay intact.

On initial root, it might be required to do a factory reset so that the device.conf gets regenerated.
Note that that factory reset will also remove Valetudo meaning that you will have to put it back after that.

#### Details

**Valetudo Binary**: `aarch64`
**Secure Boot**: `no`

#### Rooting instructions

- [UART](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/installation/dreame.html#uart)

### Xiaomi P2148<a id="xiaomi_p2148"></a>

<img src="./img/robots/xiaomi/xiaomi_p2148.jpg" width="1300" height="344"/>

The Xiaomi P2148 is made by Dreame. It is sold as:
- Mijia Robot Vacuum-Mop Ultra Slim
- Mijia Robot Vacuum Mop Ultra Slim
- Xiaomi Mijia Ultra-Thin Robot Vacuum
- Xiaomi Mijia Ultra Slim

#### Comments

Rooting is pretty easy, only requiring a 3.3v USB UART Adapter, [the Dreame Breakout PCB](https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-dreameadapter) and almost no disassembly.
All warranty seals stay intact.

With its 5.5cm height and 32.3cm diameter, this robot offers a solution for some tricky homes.
As it is china exclusive, spare parts may be hard to find in the rest of the world.

On initial root, it might be required to do a factory reset so that the device.conf gets regenerated.
Note that that factory reset will also remove Valetudo meaning that you will have to put it back after that.

There is no reset button on this robot. Instead, press and hold the two buttons for
- \< 1s for the UART shell spawn
- \> 3s for Wi-Fi reset
- \> 5s for full factory reset

#### Details

**Valetudo Binary**: `aarch64`
**Secure Boot**: `no`

#### Rooting instructions

- [UART](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/installation/dreame.html#uart)

### Xiaomi Vacuum-Mop P<a id="xiaomi_vacuummop_p"></a>

<img src="img/robots/xiaomi/xiaomi_vacuummop_p.jpg" width="1200" height="400"/>

The Vacuum-Mop P is using the Viomi cloud stack but is actually made by 3irobotix.<br/>
There are three robots with different IDs under this name, and they're all 3irobotix CRL-200S inside.<br/>
It's very confusing. If unsure, please ask us first.

These are sold under the names:
- Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop P
- Mi Robot Vacuum-Mop Pro (not the ijai one!!)
- Mijia STYJ02YM

#### Comments

Rooting is pretty easy, only requiring a Linux Laptop and a micro USB cable.<br/>
It might be required to remove the battery but that can be done without touching any warranty seals.

**Warning**:<br/>
Do not try to root the viomi.vacuum.v8 as there are many of them that will unrecoverably brick if you try to do so.
You can check if yours is a v8 by looking at the SSID of the WiFi AP the robot creates.

**Note:**<br/>
While Valetudo works with their model firmwares, the recommended rooting procedure is to flash these with a Viomi V6 firmware as that has more features.

Due to the design of the dock, it might be difficult to have the robot docked while being connected to its UART.
One useful trick to solve that is this: `sleep 300 && ./install.sh`. With that, you will have a
300s window where you can disconnect the PCB and put it in the dock. The command will keep running.

On this robot, the miio cloudKey seems to only be stored in secure storage which broke cloud communication with Valetudo.
Here's a one-liner to fix that:
`mount -o remount,rw /mnt/private && printf "%s" "$(dreame_release.na -c 7 | awk -F' = ' '/MI_KEY/{print $2}')" > "/mnt/private/ULI/factory/key.txt" && mount -o remount,ro /mnt/private`

If you're rooting your W10 Pro, just run that command before setting up Valetudo. A reboot might be required.

It is **not sold** as the L10s Ultra **Gen2**.<br/>
That's a completely different robot with a confusing name that is **not** supported.

You can tell the L10s Ultra from the unsupported but confusingly similar named L10 Ultra or the L10s Ultra Gen2 by its AI obstacle avoidance camera + the lack of an extendable mop.

#### Comments

**Important Note:**<br/>
The public root for this robot has just been released.<br/>
This makes it not unlikely that we've missed something or that there might be yet unanticipated issues.<br/>
You have been warned

If the robot fails to dock after rooting:
1. Dock it manually. Make sure that it is charging
2. Head to the dustbuilder
3. Build a firmware for manual install via SSH
4. SSH into the robot
5. Install the built firmware

The issue is that rooting flashes a newer firmware than the one installed from the factory; bypassing the normal update process.
As there seems to have been a breaking change in the communication between MCU and Linux-side-software, this breaks docking.

Installing a firmware package via SSH uses the normal OTA update process and with that fixes this mismatch.

#### Comments

**2024-09-28 Update**<br/>
Starting with robots manufactured somewhere around Q2 2024, Roborock switched to SkyHigh-brand NAND on their newly produced Q7 Max.
Unfortunately, after dumping quite a few days into it, we haven't been able to get the rooting procedure working with said NAND.

Thus, if you pick up a factory new Q7 Max then chances are that it's not rootable anymore.
The rooting procedure is still safe. It doesn't brick the robot; it just doesn't work.

You'll only find out that it's SkyHigh NAND once you've disassembled the robot and thus can't return it to the seller anymore.
Thus, right now your options are:
- Buying a used Q7 Max
- Buying from a seller that doesn't move much inventory still selling older Q7 Max
- Buying something else that is supported by Valetudo

The Conga 3290 is actually a 3irobotix CRL-200S inside. It is sold as:
- Conga 3290

#### Comments

**Important note:**<br/>
Because Congas use a non-miio cloud implementation, getting them to work with Valetudo means reflashing them to a Viomi V6.
That's possible, because the hardware is exactly the same.
