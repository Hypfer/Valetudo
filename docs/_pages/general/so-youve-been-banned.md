# So you've been banned?

Hi!

Just to get that out of the way:<br/>
Yes, I suck. I am terrible person. I am evil, vile, and manipulative.<br/>
An undeserved autocrat incapable of communication.<br/>

You're probably here because you were banned and your emotions are completely warranted.<br/>
No one should be forced to deal with someone like me.

In fact, I wouldn't want to deal with myself either.<br/>
What an insane amount of work for some stupid robot vacuum that is supposed to just work.

Here's how you can get rid of me and strip me of all my dictatorial might:<br/>
**Channel** those emotions and **contact the vendor of your Vacuum Robot**.

You could for example:
- Write them a Mail.
- Call them.
- Start a demonstration in front of their HQ.
- Go to your local dealership and put up small signs warning other customers that the device bought will not be owned.
- Go into hunger strike.

I bet you can come up with even more ideas than the idiot that is me could ever do.<br/>
You have so much creative potential. Use it! Turn that anger into motivation!

Let us not fight about a tiny cake. Let's make that cake bigger!<br/>
So big that my sorry ass becomes irrelevant.

I just parasitically sit here, because I inserted me into the sorry vendor situation to benefit from it;<br/>
Purely motivated by ego and monetary reasons.

Put me in my place!<br/>
Change the world and make what I do irrelevant!


## Uh.. okay?

Yes! With that out of the way, here are some common hints:

When you can't join the support group, first make sure that your screen name is set, has more than two real letter characters and is sane.<br/>
Something like [Zalgo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454) will get you removed by the automod. Same goes for e.g. "." as the username, as that breaks the moderation tools.

If your messages keep vanishing, chances are that that's also the automod. The code and with that its ruleset is available on GitHub:<br/>
[https://github.com/Hypfer/easterwave](https://github.com/Hypfer/easterwave/)

If it's not the screen name/username nor the automod, it might be me.<br/>

It is possible and likely that your intent was misunderstood; either by me or maybe also by yourself.<br/>
This is one of the many downsides of the ruthless push for efficiency in our current world.

Most bans in my space expire after a while, because I firmly believe that few things are final and it can always get better.<br/>
Some are permanent, though. Though, the CoC _does_ leave the possibility of an appeal _if_ you can find it.


Rest assured, I absolutely fucking hate this role and would love nothing more than not having to play it.<br/>
None of the alternatives I saw so far (and I saw _many_) do seem to be viable/sane though, so it is what it is.<br/>
Would be cool if we could just all get along and be happy little hackers.
