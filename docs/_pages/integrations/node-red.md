## Node-RED

You need to [connect valetudo to the same MQTT Broker as your Node-RED](./mqtt.html).

Build your flows with `mqtt in` and `mqtt out` nodes using the [valetudo topics](./mqtt.html).

To draw a map for your Dashboard you can use [node-red-contrib-valetudo](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-valetudo).
