## Home Assistant Integration

![image](./img/valetudo_device_homeassistant.png)

You need to [connect valetudo to your Home Assistant MQTT Broker](./mqtt.html).

Also enable discovery in Home Assistant like following:

```yaml
mqtt:
  discovery: true
  discovery_prefix: homeassistant
```

(there is no need to enable vacuum.mqtt, it will be enabled automagically).

### Example scripts.yaml snippet in Home Assistant for zoned cleaning

```yaml
vacuum_guest_room:
     alias: "vacuum guest room"
     sequence:
       - service: vacuum.send_command
         data:
           entity_id: 'vacuum.rockrobo'
           command: 'zoned_cleanup'
           params:
             'zone_ids': ['guest room']
```

For multiple zones:

```yaml
          params:
             'zone_ids': ["guest room","study room","bed room","living room"]
```

At the moment you can only send max 5 zones to clean, any more than that will be ignored.

### Example scripts.yaml snippet in Home Assistant for moving to a spot

(It's basically the same as the zoned cleaning)

```yaml
move_vacuum_to_bin_emptying_location:
     alias: "Move Vacuum to bin emptying location"
     sequence:
       - service: vacuum.send_command
         data:
           entity_id: 'vacuum.rockrobo'
           command: 'go_to'
           params:
             'spot_id': 'KitchenBin'
```

### PNG map generation

If you on Hass.io and want the map also on your dashboards of Home Assistant, use the [ICantBelieveItsNotValetudo-Addon](https://github.com/Poeschl/Hassio-Addons/tree/master/ICantBelieveItsNotValetudo).
