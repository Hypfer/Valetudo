# Supported Viomi Devices
[Shenzhen 3irobotix Co.,Ltd.](http://www.3irobotics.com/en/) produces white-label vacuum robots.
They are sold under various brands. For example `Cecotec Conga` or `Viomi`.
Since they are basically the same products, hopefully, Valetudo will eventually support all of them.


For now however, there's only experimental support for the Viomi-branded ones which run a customized firmware
including a miio interface.

If you want to find out more about robot vacuum research,
check out [Dennis' Vacuum Robot Overview](https://dontvacuum.me/robotinfo/).

This is an incomplete list of supported viomi devices. Feel free to open a PR to extend this.<br/>
