# Upgrading Valetudo

If you're using Valetudo 2021.11.0 or later, you should be able to use its integrated updater functionality.

Below are manual upgrading instructions for older versions:

## Upgrading Roborock Vacuums

### S5, V1 and S6

If you're using an S5 or V1, the recommended way to upgrade Valetudo is to flash a new image. This requires you to have SSH access to the robot.

1. Select the `Build for manual installation (requires SSH to install)` option in the [Dustbuilder](https://builder.dontvacuum.me/). You will then receive a link to a tar.gz archive by email.
2. Login to your robot via SSH.
3. Download the tar.gz file to the `/mnt/data` folder and extract it:
   - Option 1: Download tar.gz with wget
      ```sh
      cd /mnt/data
      wget <url to tar from dustbuilder>
      tar xzf <file.tar.gz>
      ```

   - Option 2: Download the tar.gz file and copy it with scp from your device to the robot

      - Execute the following to copy the file

         ```sh
         #Example 1 
         scp -i <privatekey.id_rsa> <file.tar.gz> user@<ip adress>:/mnt/data
         ```

         ```sh
         #Example 2 with values
         scp -i YOUR_PRIVATEKEY.id_rsa roborock.vacuum.s5_2034_fw.tar.gz root@192.168.8.1:/mnt/data
         ```

      - Execute the following from the robot

         ```sh
         tar xzf <file.tar.gz>
         ```

4. The robot has two systems, you cannot update a system whilst it is in use. You will be in system A by default, allowing you to update system B. Update system B (from system A) then reboot into system B:
```sh
./install_b.sh
reboot
```
1. Reconnect to your robot via SSH. You'll now be in system B, allowing you to update system A. Update system A (from system B) then reboot back into system A for normal operation:
```sh
cd /mnt/data
./install_a.sh
rm -f <file.tar.gz>
reboot
```

Your robot should now be running the latest version.

You can also stop the Valetudo service by running `/etc/init/S11valetudo stop`, and then replace the binary via scp + reboot or restart the service.

Just make sure that you try a full reflash **if you encounter any issues such as "No Map Data" or disappearing settings**.

If you don't have ssh available, you will need to do a full factory reset to re-enable OTA updates on supported robots, and then follow the initial installation procedure.


## Upgrading Dreame vacuums

1. SSH into the vacuum and kill valetudo: `killall valetudo`
2. Replace the old Valetudo binary in `/data/valetudo` with the new one
   - `wget https://github.com/Hypfer/Valetudo/releases/latest/download/valetudo-{armv7,armv7-lowmem,aarch64} -O /data/valetudo`
   - Make sure to use the correct binary as documented in the [supported robots](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) section
   - If you get a "Text file busy" error, it means Valetudo is still running. Try to kill it again.
   - If the issue still occurs, delete the old binary before uploading the new one
3. Reboot your vacuum: `reboot`
