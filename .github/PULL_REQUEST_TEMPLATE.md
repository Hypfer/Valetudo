**STOP**

I do not take pull requests.

They fundamentally do not make any sense for the style of both software itself and how I am building it.
Software is my creative outlet. I gain energy from it, but only if I actually get to do the creative part and get to do it without compromise.
That is what drives me and why this exists in the first place.

Some people gain something out of "being helpful" regardless of any modifiers. Some people enjoy being part of some bigger collective/committee.
I do not. I require absolute autonomy in doing so, otherwise the drive breaks down entirely, which is not what I nor what you want.

I _also_ strongly believe that software designed by drive-by committee members usually fucking sucks.
There is a place for it, of course, but not on my lawn. The world has enough bureaucrats already.

Hence, if you open one regardless, you will be banned.
Yes, this needs to be put this bluntly. I know. I wouldn't have thought that either.
You wouldn't believe what absurd constructs people make up in their mind to read a "no" as a "yes".

I hope that regardless of not adhering to common expectations, this code brought value to you.
Thank you for understanding and happy hacking

Side-note:
If you actually do have something of value to offer that I could not pull off and that actually fits the philosophy and vision, you will also be sane enough to read this, nod, and then have a chat as a peer; not on a mission, but having a shared moment.
I know that people like you are out there. Somewhere. Being drowned by the noise.
