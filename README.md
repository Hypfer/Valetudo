    <h2>Free your vacuum from the cloud</h2>
</div>

Valetudo is a cloud replacement for vacuum robots that enables local-only operation. It is not a custom firmware.
That means that it cannot change anything about how the robot operates.

What it can do, however, is keep your data private and enable you to connect your robot
to your home automation system without having to detour through a vendor cloud. Not having to leave your local network reduces latency, and means you don't have to depend on a third-party service that might not be reachable due to your internet connection
being down or some servers in the datacenter being on fire.

Valetudo aims to be proof that easy-to-use and reliable smart appliances are possible without any cloud and/or account requirements.
Maybe at some point it might help convince vendors that there is another, non-cloud, way of doing things.

By default, Valetudo provides control over your vacuum robot via a **responsive web interface** that works on all of your devices.
It can be used on phones, tablets as well as your desktop computer.


Furthermore, there's a **REST-interface** documented with **Swagger UI** as well as **MQTT**.
With support for both **Homie** and **Home Assistant autodiscovery** for MQTT, you should be able to connect Valetudo to
the open-source smart home software of your choice.

There's also [an android companion app](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/companion_apps/valetudo_companion.html) that helps
setting-up your newly-rooted vacuum.
