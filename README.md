### Getting started
You'll find information on how to install valetudo in the deployment folder.

If your vacuum is already rooted **and you know what you're doing** 
just download the latest valetudo binary from the releases page and scp it to `/usr/local/bin/`.
Then grab the `valetudo.conf` from the deployment folder put it inside `/etc/init/`
 run `service valetudo start` and you're good. Don't forget to `chmod +x` the binary.

### Remote API
If you are looking forward getting support for the map on any other device (like OpenHab, FHEM,..), this is now supported using Valetudo.
The current API can be found at:
`YourRobotID/api/remote/map`

The current implementation allows you to grab:
* The recent generated map as PNG (grab it at: `YOUR.VACUUM.ROBOT.IP/mapsrc`)
* The map contains the 2D contour and configurable: path, charger, current robot position
* The position of the charger (`charger[X,Y]`: position in px to overlay on the generated image)
* The position of the robot (`robot[X,Y]`: position in px to overlay on the generated image, `robotAngle`: angle in [0-360] of the robot (0: oriented to the top, 90: oriented to the right))

### Misc
The current version of valetudo is the result of 8 not so rainy afternoons. Expect bugs.

Theres a Todo.md with stuff that needs to be done


Valetudo does not feature access controls and I'm not planning on adding it since I trust my local network.
You could just put a reverse proxy with authentication in front of it if you really need it.

Please don't just forward the port to make it accessible on the go..
### FAQ
**Q:** Why the name?

**A:** Valetudo is the roman name for the greek goddess Hygieia which is the goddess of health, cleanliness and hygiene. Also I'm bad at naming things.
